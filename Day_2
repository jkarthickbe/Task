What is a JavaScript window?

The window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy. It  is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of the Document object model(DOM);

What is a JavaScript document?

A document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.
The first thing that gets loaded into the browser is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in the window object. 
Properties related to window objects are length, innerWidth, innerHeight, caches, etc.

There was a document object too so what about it then?

So after the window gets loaded then thereâ€™s a document (HTML, PHP, or another document) loaded inside that window, 
and the properties related to that document is stored in the document object. Properties related to document objects are title, URL, cookie, etc.
Window Vs Document
Window object : It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy as shown in Figure 1.

Document object : Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page. 
Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page

The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.

You can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object. In the below example, 
title is the property of document object.
The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods. Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior. 
In the below example window.open() opens a new tab or window and document.open() creates a blank document within the window.
